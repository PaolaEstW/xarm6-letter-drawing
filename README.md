# XArm6 Letter Drawing Robot ✍️🤖

This project demonstrates how to use **hand gesture recognition** with **MediaPipe** to control an **xArm6 collaborative robot** for drawing letters.  
The system interprets vowels (`A, E, I, O, U`) from hand signs and commands the robot arm to draw them.

---

## 🚀 Overview
- `signdetect.py`: Detects vowels from live hand gestures using **MediaPipe Hands**.
- `signlan2.py`: Sends drawing commands to the **xArm6** robot to trace letters.
- Real-time processing with OpenCV to track gestures.
- Robot feedback loop ensures accurate drawing in 2D space.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Hardware**: xArm6, webcam
- **Programming**: Python
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, MediaPipe, xArm SDK
- **OS/Env**: Windows 10, Conda environment

---

## ✨ Features
- Real-time vowel recognition from hand gestures
- Letter-by-letter robot drawing (`A, E, I, O, U`)
- Extendable for full alphabet and word drawing
- Visual servoing for correction
